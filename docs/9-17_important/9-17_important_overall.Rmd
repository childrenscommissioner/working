<h3>About this data</h3>

Children aged 9-17 were asked the following question about future priorities: “When you grow up, which things, if any, do you think will be most important for you to have a good life? Choose up to 5 things from the list below.”

* Having a good education
* Good friends
* A good job or career
* Enough money to buy the things I need
* Getting on well with my current family
* Starting my own family
* A nice home to live in
* Good mental health
* Good physical health
* Being part of a good local community
* Living in a nice area with things to do
* Everyone being treated fairly
* A healthy environment and planet


The chart below shows which topics and themes children selected as their most important priorities in order for them to have a good life when they grow up. The single most common choice was ‘a good job or career’ (69%), followed by ‘enough money to buy the things I need’ (59%), ‘good friends’ (57%), and ‘having a good education’ and ‘good mental health’ (both chosen by 52% of children).

<br/>


<h3>What do children think is important for their future?</h3>

*Note children can select more than one option*
