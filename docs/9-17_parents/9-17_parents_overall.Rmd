<h3> About this data</h3>

Children aged 9-17 were asked: “When you grow up, how likely do you think it is that you will have a better life than your parents?”

_* Very likely_
_* Fairly likely_
_* Neither likely nor unlikely_
_* Fairly unlikely_
_* Very unlikely_


On average, children are more likely than not to think that they will have a better life than their parents when they grow up. Around half of children (52%) thought it was likely or very likely, whereas only 1 in 11 (9%) thought it was unlikely or very unlikely. A substantial proportion of children – nearly 2 in 5 – were essentially unsure, and said it was neither likely nor unlikely
