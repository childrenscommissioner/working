<h3>About this data</h3>

Children aged 9-17 were asked the following question about future worries: “When you grow up, which things, if any, are you most worried that you won’t have? Choose up to 5 things from the list below.”


* Having a good education
* Good friends
* A good job or career
* Enough money to buy the things I need
* Getting on well with my current family
* Starting my own family
* A nice home to live in
* Good mental health
* Good physical health
* Being part of a good local community
* Living in a nice area with things to do
* Everyone being treated fairly
* A healthy environment and planet


The chart below shows which things children worried most about not having when they grow up.

<br/>

<h3>What are children worried about for their future?</h3>

*Note children can select more than one option*

```{r}
dat<-table_f("")[!grepl("dont",variable)][,.(c=sum(wt)),by=.(variable,value)][,perc:=round(c/sum(c),2)*100,by=.(variable)][value==1 & !grepl("Other",variable)][,.(variable,perc)]

ggplot(dat,
       aes(x=reorder(variable,perc),y=perc))+
  geom_col(fill="light blue",colour="grey20")+coord_flip()+geom_text(aes(label=paste0(perc,"%")),hjust=1)+
  theme_bw()+xlab("")+ylab("% of 9-17 yr olds")

```
